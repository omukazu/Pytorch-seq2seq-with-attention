# Pytorch Seq2seq with Attention

This repository contains a sequence to sequence model with attention using Pytorch 1.1.0.

### Motivation
The seq2seq model introduced in Pytorch tutorial seems to be affected by PAD symbols,
so I introduce this model which ignores PAD symbols.

### with soft attention mechanism
